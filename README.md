# React Native Roundtable Notes

The Roundtable is an tightly knit meetup, composed of
people who already have React Native experience, and/or a strong agenda towards
it, that are willing to share their experience and promote mutual learning and
advancement around the same table. 

We hope to make the meetups as open and inviting as possible as well as very
professional and hands-on (please invite whoever you feel belongs).

## How this repo works

quote how this repo works verbatim:
